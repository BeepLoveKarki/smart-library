As soon as any student enters the library, he connects to the raspberry pi hotspot via his android or laptop and logs in via his username and password. 


Since the website contains various features, we discuss them below:

<b>a) Book requests and responses</b>

The student uses this feature if any book he is searching for is not found in the library!!! He sends a request to thelibrary admin (who uses the admin panel) for the book!!! As soon as the book arrives he receives the notification of arrival!!! The live hosting of this site, makes it easier for him to know book arrival via home!!!



<b>b) Clear Fine amount</b>

The student may use this feature to clear the fine amount allocated to him vai electronic pay service!!!


<b>c) Locate or Find Books</b>

The student may use this feature to view the location of the book he is searching for in the library, i.e. the shelf number, column number and row number.

<b>d) Issue Books</b>

The student clicks this button and chooses the book he requires. Then after getting the book on his hand, he just shows the book to the rfid reader placed over the table!!! The book is then automatically issued for him!!!

<b>e) Return or Renew Books</b>

For returning or renewing the book the students has taken, he just brings it, clicks this button, chooses the one to return among his issued books list and shows the book to the rfid reader!!! The book is then automatically returned!!!
He then puts the book over the returning desk!!!


All these transactions can be checked via the Transactions anchor placed on page top!!!


<b>f) Send Feedback</b>

The student may send any kind of feedback to the library admin via this button!!!



It also contains an admin panel where library admin logs in with a password provided to him!!!


The features of admin panel are:
